Programmatically self-downloading movies from [hoichoi.tv](https://www.hoichoi.tv/)'s database. Script will take care of picking up each and every movie listed as well as avoiding of duplicates.

## Local

```foo.py``` : Script to download all the movies to your local system

## Cloud

```bar.ipynb``` : PyNb to load all the movies to your Google Drive (using Colab as the middleware)

This is to be used unless your network speeds are as fast as Google's. Make sure you have over 100GB of free Google Drive space. All the movies in the site's database will be transferred to your Google Drive.
